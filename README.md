# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This program is a tool for visualizing the behavior of different sorting algorithms. It allows users to see how the
algorithm sorts an array of values step by step.

### Visualization of the following sorting algorithms:

- [X] Bubble sort
- [ ] Insertion sort
- [ ] Selection sort
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Heap sort
- [X] Bogo sort

### Additional features:

- [ ] Adjustable array size and animation speed
- [ ] Option to randomly shuffle the array before sorting

## Logbook:

### 23rd of Jan 2023:

### Done today

- Added support for pillars to be visualized and generated
  ### TODO

    - [X] Add a slider to select how many pillars that will be generated
    - [X] Implement one or more of the sorting algorithms named above

### 30th of Jan 2023:

### Done today

- Added bogo and bubble sort
- Added sliders to decide speed of sorting and amount of pilars to be generated
- Added a gradient to the pilars to add some color
- General fixing of some bugs
- Made my website be hosted by github (https://winterwolfsv.github.io/visual_sorting/)

  ### TODO

    - [ ] Fix the error that you can start multiple sorting algorithms at once
    - [X] Fix the error that the smallest pillar is transparent
    - [ ] Implement more algorithms
    - [X] Comment my code
    - [ ] Clean up the mess people call javascript

### 31st of Jan 2023:

### Done today

- Commented a lot of my code
- Added support to change the colors of the pillars
- Smallest pillar is not transparent anymore

  ### TODO

    - [ ] Implement more algorithms
    - [ ] Fix the error that you can start multiple sorting algorithms at once
    - [ ] Implement a stop button that stops the current algorithm from running
