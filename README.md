#**Sorting Algorithm Visualizer**
This program is a tool for visualizing the behavior of different sorting algorithms. It allows users to see how the algorithm sorts an array of values step by step.

##**Features**
###Visualization of the following sorting algorithms:
- Bubble sort
- insertion sort
- selection sort
- merge sort
- quick sort
- heap sort

###Additional feautures
- Adjustable array size and animation speed
- Option to randomly shuffle the array before sorting
