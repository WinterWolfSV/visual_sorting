# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This program is a tool for visualizing the behavior of different sorting algorithms. It allows users to see how the
algorithm sorts an array of values step by step.

### Visualization of the following sorting algorithms:

- [ ] Bubble sort
- [ ] Insertion sort
- [ ] Selection sort
- [ ] Merge sort
- [ ] Quick sort
- [ ] Heap sort

### Additional features:

- [ ] Adjustable array size and animation speed
- [ ] Option to randomly shuffle the array before sorting

## Logbook:

### 23rd of Jan 2023:

### Done today

- Added support for pillars to be visualized and generated
  ### TODO

    - Add a slider to select how many pillars that will be generated
    - Implement one or more of the sorting algorithms named above

### 30th of Jan 2023:

### Done today

- Added bogo and bubble sort
- Added sliders to decide speed of sorting and amount of pilars to be generated
  ### TODO

    - Fix my bad code
    - Comment
    - Finish today's README.md
